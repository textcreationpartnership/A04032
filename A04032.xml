            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O whom may I better dedicate this Booke of Numbers, then to your ſelfe, who haue bin trained vp in the Art of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, euen from your infancie? I ſpeake it to your deſerued prayſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Many go beyond you in the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but few or none in the practick. I could wiſh, that ſome men could not Arithmetize and Merchandize ſo well as they doe; Who whiles they number their wealth, their wit, their learning, their offices, their dignities, their cattel, their lands, their rents, their monies, the better part of their life vaniſheth away: This is a fruitleſſe and careleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7836:4"/>kinde of numbring. It is ſaid, that the Athenians (nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeculatiues, but bad practiques) had money to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber onely. What doe men nou-a-daies, but continually hoord vp Gods bleſſings, to number them? And yet when they haue made their totall account, they can neuer attaine to the Art of true Numbring. To weane therefore the world, in what I may, from ſo ſordidous and prepoſterous a kinde of Arithmetick, I haue compiled this worke, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>The Secrets of Numbers,</hi> contrary to the practice of our common Arithmeticians, as the two Zones are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant the one from the other; Wiſhing them, that among ſo many Theologicall, Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall numbers heere ſet downe, they would thinke on one more excellent, which is, To number their daies. Which to doe, in one word, is no otherwiſe, then to take ſomething from the pleaſures of the world, which they haue greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, by way of ſubtraction; and to adde ſo much to godly endeuours neglected by them, by way of multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For, the time is ſhort wee ſpend in vertue, but long which wee conſume in vice. There is no Arithmetick comparable to this. Wherefore <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> reducing all things into Number, making his triplicity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the end concluded thus: <hi>Si recta ratione vixeris, male acta dolendo, et bene acta gaudendo; deoſque oraueris, vt opus tuum perficiant: tum exuto corpore, profectus in aetherem, eris immortalis Deus.</hi> I doe perſwade my ſelfe, that after you haue read this booke at vacant hours, you will bee a better <hi>Pythagorean</hi> than
<pb facs="tcp:7836:4"/>euer you were; Or at leaſt by turning ouer Gods Booke (as many times you doe) you will not forget this one leſſon: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordare nouiſſima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis. Pythagoras</hi> in all his life-time, for all his numbring, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not this leſſon; but <hi>Salomon,</hi> wiſer then he, did. For that ſome things heere may be aboue your capacity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more then a Delian ſwimmer for the ſearching of their bottome, I would not haue you blame me altogether: For, as in other tractates I haue laboured to inſtruct the vnlearned onely; ſo in this I haue done my beſt endeuour to ſatisfie both the learned and vnlearned, with equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt conſider, we liue in a world of learning; and it is in reading of bookes, as it is in banquetting: Not onely groſſe and ſimple viands, but the moſt dainty and delicate are called for, though they be ſomething ſharp &amp; diſtaſting to the ſtomach. I doe not doubt, but vpon conference had with you, I ſhall be able to breake the ſhell, that the kernell of many abſtruſe and ſymbolicall myſteries, neuer brought to light before, ſhall bee farre more pleaſing vnto you: which, according to our ſmall skill, I ſhall alwaies willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeuour to performe. To him, who is that infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Vnity in Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Trinity in Vnity,</hi> according to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Symbole, I commend you and yours.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7836:6"/>not a man thinke it were both a damnable, temerarious, and prepoſterous kinde of enterpize? But theſe men doe worſe, as much as Paganiſme exceedeth any hereſie whatſoeuer. For, what is it to our Chriſtian Religion eſtabliſhed already, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſo many witneſſes both from heauen and earth, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the bloud of ſo many bleſſed Saints, to bee made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the religion of Paynims? Is it not enough for vs to know Ieſus Chriſt crucified, to ſpeake with Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> For, admit that it bee done by way of publique deteſtation and confutation, yet this is not enough. For, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of ſome hereſies, <hi>Nominaſſe eas tantùm, eſt refutaſſe:</hi> ſo it is heere with ſuch Paganicall ſuperſtitions: They are ſo monſtrous, ſo impious, ſo abſurd, ſo contrary to our Chriſtian Verity, that they neede no confutation. Nay, more than this; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, or to beſtowe much time in the detection of them, according to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Rule, is to allowe of them; to giue them the name of Religion, is to ſupplant Chriſts true Religion; to open their fopperies by publique writing, is to thruſt the old and new Teſtament by the ſhoulders out of the Schoole of Chriſtians, and to place inſteade of them, the <hi>Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> of the Saracens, the <hi>Fotoque</hi> of the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Alcaron. This is, with the old Academicks, to bring in their <gap reason="foreign">

This is <hi>mouere chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das non mouendas.</hi> Nay, pray God, beginning with thoſe Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks and Scepticks, to doubt of euery thing, wee proue not in the end plaine Atheiſts, or mungrell Chriſtians. Alas, that I ſhould write it! Chriſtian Religion was neuer in ſo great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as it is now. For, whereas in times paſt wee were but halfe Chriſtians, for want of true knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; now, by reaſon of too much knowledge (I meane, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the braine) wee are ſwarued cleane from the rules of
<pb facs="tcp:7836:6"/>true Chriſtianity. <hi>Chriſtianitatis ſimulacrum fortè gerimus,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>rem ipſam deſerimus.</hi> As touching my ſelfe therefore and this preſent diſcourſe, a kinde of neceſſity hath enforced me to make this proteſtation. I was neuer yet a broacher of newe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; knowing, that nouelty and ſingularity were euer the concomitants of hereſie. There are three things that haue kept me hitherto in the Catholique faith; The Word of God, the Catholique Church, the Concent of Fathers. In theſe three I haue placed my anchor. As for Popery and Puritaniſme (two mayne oppoſites and extremes, though the one leſſe than the other) I haue alwaies deteſted. Neither haue I maintained any perfidiouſneſſe of new error or hereſie, as Heretickes are wont to doe: neither haue I beleeued (to ſpeake with <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>any thing that the Catholique Church vnbeleeueth,</hi> but haue alwaies with Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> thought that to bee the true and orthodox faith, which the Catholique Church hath taught mee. As I haue ſaid in our bookes againſt Antichriſt and his members: ſo I ſay again; <hi>Ego nihil ſanctum, nihil firmum in meis dict is ſcriptiſue eſſe volo, niſi quantum probet</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I hope I am an vnworthy member. And again, I wil ſay with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Heldibius; Nobis nihil placet, niſi quod eccleſiaſticum eſt: et publicè in eccleſia dicere non timemus ne iuxta</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Platonem <hi>et diſcipulos eorum qui ſub nomine Chriſtianoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> introducunt dogma Gentilium, &amp;c.</hi> See whether S. <hi>Hierome</hi> was not afrayd, that the pleaſing doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and others, would pull downe the auſterulous Religion of Chriſt &amp; his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. See againe, how dangerouſly ſome men goe about, in ſtead of ſound and orthodoxall aſſertions, contrary to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, to bring-in bare elements and rudiments of the world, to the ſcandall of our Chriſtian Religion. Of whom I may truly ſpeake, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and others, who maintained Chriſts doctrine, with the teſtimony of Gentiles; <hi>Quid nobis opus eſt, propter defenſionem Chriſtianae Religionis, quaerere

                  </gap>rationi contrarijs plena ſuit?</hi> I ſpeake not this by way of an Apology for my ſelfe, or that I meane to excuſe my pen from error co-incident to other men, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infallible or inſeparable marke of our mortality), nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to free this numerall diſcourſe preſented to thy view, from all manner of exceptions, or ſtumbling blocks laid in my way. For, I dare not warrant all theſe Numbers and diuiſions, except they bee read with iudgement, charitably, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood, candidouſly and ingenuouſly conſtrued. And ſo I doubt not, but the greater part of them will be found not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſound, according to probability, but Theologically and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxically ſound. I meane it of thoſe who are borrowed our of Fathers or School-men. Others taken from thoſe Iewiſh Rabbines, I dare not vindicate from all exception. In a great houſe, to vſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſimilitude, there bee veſſels of honor and diſhonor. And in ſo large a field as I haue walked, how can it bee, but ſome things muſt needs diſtaſte, although perhaps the better part may relliſh well? If then any thing offend the palate, or ſauour erroniouſly, God forbid it ſhould bee laid to my charge, who am but the collector, not the Author of them. For, as all my grounds are taken ont of choſe Ancients (a few excepted); as namely, <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Ariſtotle, Macrobius, Philo, Themiſtius,</hi> and others: So all our Numbers, and their extendures for the moſt part, haue been borrowed from ſacred Scripture, antient Doctors of the Church Rabbines, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch eſpecially as ſauour any thing of Theologie. Others haue been ſelected out of Philoſophers, both natural &amp; morall, Aſtronomers, Phiſicians, Anatomiſts, Mathematicians, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians Arithmeticians, Paracelſians, ciuill Lawyers, to the number of an hundred and vpwards. All that I haue done to
<pb facs="tcp:7836:7"/>the full compleating of this diſcourſe, hath beene, to explane and open ſuch kinde of myſteries as haue been included or ſhut vp in theſe numbers. For, though they are called ſecrets, for their ſecret and hidden vertues infuſed in them; yet many of them, by the light which I haue ſhewed, are liable euen to common capacities. But I haue not vnfolded all, leſt I might incurre the diſpleaſure of the goddeſſe <hi>Eleuſina,</hi> or ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Rules of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelf, who enioined to his ſcholars a fiue-yeers ſilence; and vnder the veile of Numbers (as thoſe <hi>Lullianes</hi> by their primary letters alphabeticall) hath ſhadowed and coueted the better part of his learning, to the intent the common people ſhould not vnderſtand them. If then I ſhould haue made all things common to thoſe vulgar capacities, it would fall out with me, as he ſaith: <hi>Arcana defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent eſſe aroana, &amp; glonia ſua, depoſite velo, ab indignis &amp; profanis hominibus contaminarentur ac praculcarentur.</hi> As therefore I ſaid before, I dare not warrant them all without exception or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; being not mine owne proper, but the collections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: ſo now I ſay again, that I would not haue any man to eſteem me from their dignity or indignity, but rather what I am from miue owne proper writings. For, if they ſhall lay hereſie to my charge (which is the greateſt impeachment that can happen to a true Chriſtian), I will ſay with <hi>Ruffinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is well ſaid by One, <hi>Deus vbi vult, quando vult, quibus vult, dona ſua impertit.</hi> Some perchance will obiect,
<pb facs="tcp:7836:8"/>that the better part of theſe are not properly Numbers, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions and diſtinctions. To whom I anſwer thus: If number be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, from diſtribution, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> will haue it, then let them ſhew mee any diuiſion or diſtinction, that can be framed without number, diſtribution, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without which they may not conſiſt, no more than num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can without his equall or vnequall parts. And yet they are not all bare numbers included in this diſcourſe: for, beſides them, there will be found many Theological Principles, many Rules from Aſtronomy, Geometry, Phyſick; morall, naturall, and metaphyſicall Philoſophie, the Art Spagyrick, Cabala; as no book (I beleeue) of ſo ſmall a volume, wil contain the like. I haue ſpaced, beſides, among thoſe ancient Hebrew &amp; Iewiſh Doctors, for the enquiry of ſacred Symboles; wherewith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, they ſeem to me moſt chiefly to abound. Of whom One writeth thus: <hi>Haebraeorum doctrina velut circulus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium figurarum capaciſsimus, latiùs patet quam vlla alia ſectarum diſciplina.</hi> Others will ſay, that I haue been too curious in the vnfolding of them, and that I haue giuen them too much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. I anſwer: If I ſhould haue blurred my paper with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> with the Cylinders of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> with the Sphere of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> with the woodden Doue of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas,</hi> with the ſtrange Paradoxes of Stoicks; I might more iuſtly bee condemned of curioſity. As touching their vertue, this is mine opinion: I doo hould, with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, that Number by it ſelf hath no power of working; for, it is a quantity, and no quality: but the reaſon of number, which is (as it were) the form or image of time, concluding all the works of nature, worketh things admirable. If therefore thou haſt any deſire to be one of <hi>Pythagor as</hi> ſcholars, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to art and iudgement, to number well, read this book with attention, ſobriety, diſcretion. I dare aſſure thee, that it will be a key vnto thee, to open the ſecrets of any ſcience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer:
<pb facs="tcp:7836:8"/>for, in this little room are incloſed the flowres and bloſſomes of thirty yeers ſtudy, gotten together with great pains, labour and induſtry. For, whereas I intended, many yeers ago to treat of ſuch a ſubiect; whatſoeuer by continuall reading liked mee, or was fitting for this preſent argument, I cauſed carefully to be ſet down in my note-book, according to the example of <hi>Plinie</hi> the elder, leſt the lubricity of my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould fail me.</p>
            <p>And now hauing made an whole body of them, partly from addition, partly from illuſtration, I preſent them heer vnto thy view; hoping, that from their worth, or from mine intention (which hitherto hath bin to further the ſtudies of yong ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) they will be acceptable vnto thee. This one thing I muſt confeſſe, that, for the ſpace of one whole yeers contemplation in the art of numbring, I got more to the enriching of my poor ſtore-houſe, than in ſeuen yeers theorie I was able to doo by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſtudy whatſoeuer. Yea, more than that, I haue been ſo rauiſhed with the ſtudy of numbers, that if any man will ask me, What is the chiefeſt Good next to God, that in this life I take delight in? I muſt anſwer, Number; if, What the ſecond? Number; if, What the third? Number. So that, as <hi>Auenzaar</hi> the Babylonian ſaith, <hi>He that knowes to number well, knoweth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly all things;</hi> iumping with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> in this point. Thus, deſiring God, with <hi>Lactantius,</hi> that I may liue no longer than to doo good to his Church, and to that Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal wherein I liue, I bid thee Farewell.</p>

               <p>As touching their excellency, though the teſtimonies of Heathens are copious in this point, yet in ſacred Writ wee ſhall finde plenty enough. For, whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>God had di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poſed ali things according to number, waight and meaſure,</hi> what is ſignified vnto vs, but that when he created the world out of the lump before it had, he made it an harmonious body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining number, order, beauty, and proportion, in all the parts thereof. Now, as the Frame of the world ſoon ſhewes vnto vs, that there is a GOD, the firſt and indiuiſible Vnity from whence all other harmony proceedeth: ſo this God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not to be meaſured with any quantity, as hauing all number within himſelf; yet the next way to knowe him perfectly, is, To begin with numbring. For, <hi>Except wee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, without confounding the Perſons, and diuiding the ſubſtance</hi> (as holy Father <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith in his Creed), <hi>we ſhall neuer be ſaued.</hi> And it is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation: there is no number, little or great, begetting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or mixt of both, which hath not ſome ſpark of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in it, wherein God may not be ſaid familiarly to be known of vs, yea, euen to dwell with vs; as farther in this diſcourſe ſhall bee made manifeſt. For example: Our common Creed read in the Church, being a Summe or an Abbridgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the myſteries of Chriſtian Belief, cannot bee made knowne vnto vs without the ternary Number; ſeeing it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of three parts. The firſt is, To beleeue in one GOD, Father omnipotent, Creator of heauen and earth. The ſecond is, To beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, God and Man. The third is, To beleeue in the holy Ghoſt. The firſt is a Symbole of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the next, of our redemption; the laſt, of our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Again: all the Commandements of God conſiſt of two, from whence the whole Decalogue is deriued: whereof three Precepts, being of the firſt Table, concern our knowledge and loue of God; the other ſeuen, the loue of our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Now, it is manifeſt, that the myſteries of our Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot bee knowne without Numbers; no more can many parts of Scripture: for, the Book called the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> ſtiled by the holy Ghoſt it ſelf, hath ſo many dark and proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Numbers, ſo many myſticall and ſymbolicall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrables,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7836:10"/>that, without the Art of numbring, it were fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for a man to ſay, that he were able to vnderſtand them.

               <p>Intellectuall Muſick is compounded of three; <hi>Diapazon, Diapente, Diateſſaron,</hi> reſembling the three parts of the minde, that is, vnderſtanding, ſenſe, and habite. The firſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth ſeuen things; the minde, imagination, memory, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, opinion, reaſon, ſcience. The ſecond aimeth at foure; ſight, hearing, ſmelling, touching. The third conſiſteth of three; increaſe, height, decrement. That which is called En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious, is correſpondent to naturall and morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; Diatonicall, to Theology and Ciuill Law; Chromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, to the Mathematick and Economick. That which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiue, reſembleth the changes of mens liues, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions of manners. Of all ſymphonicall harmony, juſtice hath euer bin taken for the principall: ſo that there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold number or concord; Arithmeticall, Geometricall, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall. <hi>Proclus,</hi> an antient Philoſopher, conſtituteth fiue kindes of Numbers; in the voice, in proportion, in the ſoule, in reaſon, and in diuine things: ſo that by putting Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Number to the other three mentioned before, is to make a perfect harmony. Vnder which I include all thoſe Numbers cited in Scripture, touching God, or the three Perſons in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; all thoſe which are mentioned by thoſe antient Doctors of the Church, School-men and others, who haue treated of holy myſteries: whereof this Book ſhall affoord great plenty. As touching the antiquity of Numbers, ſome make a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether they bee more antient than that which wee call
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7836:13"/>
                  <hi>Superficies,</hi> and the line. <hi>Macrobius</hi> reſolueth it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: It muſt needs be, ſaith hee,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> in Somu. Scip. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> that Number is more antient than the other; for that from the line we come to the other, as to the firſt, from whence all thoſe Geometrical lines or rules are borrowed. The firſt finder-out of Numbers among the Heathens, is <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Samian: ſome others attribute it to another <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was an excellent Grauer or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. <hi>Linius</hi> will haue them to be the inuention of <hi>Minerua:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Polidor. Virg: l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> others aſcribe it to <hi>Mercurie.</hi> Howſoeuer, we need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much about their antiquity, ſeeing there is no Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, old or new, which can make them ſo antient as the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> or That of <hi>Numbers;</hi> where both in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and in the numbring of God's people, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> a remarkable Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is giuen vs, to knowe how greatly the vſe of them was reſpected in thoſe daies. So that as God began and finiſhed the Frame of the world with Numbers: ſo he will deſtroy the ſame, by numbring of his people vnto judgement.</p>
               <p>Conſidering, then, all things are made capable of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the heauens, earth, ſea, the ſoule and body of man, yea, the Angels themſelues (if wee beleeue thoſe Cabaliſts); what is that which is not comprehended vnder Numbers? It is God himſelf, who is that Vnity infinite, eternall, ſimple, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: in whom as there is no change; ſo nothing can bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or taken away from him. Who again as he is One from euerlaſting: ſo is he vnchangeable in his purpoſe, vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his actions, paſt finding-out in his waies, making his Throne that he ſitteth vpon, like himſelf, that the proportion of the one and other might bee equall; according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that learned School-man. To ſay then, that God is not to bee comprehended vnder any Number (beeing an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence numberleſſe), cannot be offenſiue, ſeeing that <hi>Maximus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>17</hi>
                  </note> an antient Father, teacheth vs, <hi>His God-head is indiuiſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is without quantity: hee is without quantity, becauſe hee is not endued with any quality: he is void of quaiity, becauſe hee is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: he is ſimple, becauſe he is interminate; interminate, becauſe hee is infinite; infinite, becauſe he is immoueable; immoueable, becauſe he wanteth beginning; and he could not haue a beginning, becauſe hee

Which, for auoiding of confuſednes &amp; faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes, I haue, according to their ſeuerall properties, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them all in a Summe, not omitting one Number from the leaſt to the greateſt; from the Vnary, to the Number of fifty, and vpwards. Neither haue wee barely ſet down their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, properties and effects, but haue vnlocked many of their myſteries, now and then by diuiding them, now and then by adding light vnto them, and now and then by bringing in authority and reaſon for the farther explication, explanation, and illuſtration of them. All which being performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the module of our skill, learning, and judgement, we thought it good in the later end of this diſcourſe, to proceed to other ſpeculations; borrowing their light from hence, or which properly are annexed heerunto by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

Which a man can hardly beleeue, if he ſhould bee the Author of that transformation of ſoules into the bodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, as it hath been vntruely and impiouſly laid vnto his charge: For, if a Dog (to make a compariſon) that hath long

For, he taught this tranſanimation touching the body, and not the ſoule; or at leaſt, touching the affection of the ſoule, not concerning the going of it out of one body into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

And yet his Saying was not manifeſt, but a meer riddle; whereby hee went about to ſhew to that rude world, that the firſt Matter was not onely capable of all kinde of formes, but that it was auarous and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and that it was not contented with any form.

                  </note> But (to come to our matter) <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Symbole was this; <hi>The beginning of all beginnings was Infinitum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num, &amp; Duo.</hi> Vnder which three, he ſignified God, <hi>Idea,</hi> and that which the Philoſopher calls The firſt Matter. All which three meeting together, and producing that which we call <hi>Tetraclys</hi> (which, according to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> account, is the Fountain and Spring of all production, the beginning of all emanation, and the permanent of all immutable ſubſtance), it is impoſſible, but that much diuinity ſhould bee incloſed vnder this Symbole. Now, although this Number, One, bee not numerable, by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7836:15"/>reaſon of his indiuiſibleneſſe, yet it produceth and createth innumerous forms of things of it ſelf, and within it ſelf. Hee therefore that knowes not what is infinite, what is One, what is two, according to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> diuine rule of numbring, knowes little or nothing touching the Trinity: for, One ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Eſſence; two, the different reſpect of Perſons; <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> the propriety of beginnings, that is, the Eternity it ſelf. Whether then wee reſpect this Number barely, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all Numbers, or figuratiuely, the vnion betwixt the Father and the Son, God and Man, Chriſt and his Church, the ſoule and body of man, the wife and the husband, it muſt needs be a ſacred Number. So then, as One cannot bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe it is a ſingle Number (ſome account it for no Number, but the beginning of Numbers): no more can the humanity bee diuided from the God head, the Church from her Spouſe, the ſoule from the body, the wife from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For, this is a Maxime both in Philoſophy and Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Sola <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit as omnino ſimplex, à ſe perfecta, non egreditur ſe: ſed indiuidua ſimplicitate &amp; ſolitaria ſibi cohaeret.</hi> Wherefore, ſetting all other vertues aſide that this Number hath, it is eaſily to bee gathered, that there is none that ſheweth vnto vs more cleerly the Deity, the co-vnion of Chriſt with his Man-hood, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of that indiuiſible Vnity, than this doth. <hi>Which hypoſtaticall vnion</hi> (to ſpeak with <hi>Damaſcen</hi>) <hi>exceedeth all other vnions whatſoeuer.</hi>

               <p>Let vs ſee now how far this Number extendeth. There is one God, one Sauiour, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one world, one Phoenix in the world, one Sunne, one Moon, one Ark of <hi>Noe,</hi> one Church, one Deluge, one Zodiack, one King in his Kingdome, one Shepheard of his Flock, one Leader among the Cranes, one Soueraign among Bees, one chief Ruler in the City, one ſoule in the body, one head.

               <p>AFter <hi>Monas,</hi> this is the firſt Number, called <hi>Par in compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> hauing ſome reſemblance to the firſt matter which is incompoſite. It is the weakeſt Number of all, becauſe of it ſelfe, without the helpe of others, it worketh nothing. The reaſon is, euery thing exiſtent is coupled with the terne Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and is made perfect with the quaterne. As for example: bodies are meaſured by their longitude, latitude, and profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie; ſpirits, by the memorie, vnderſtanding, will. So they are perfited by the fourth Number. As memorie, alluding to vnderſtanding and will, is capable of the duall Number; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the will, of the ternarie: the will vnto both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the quaterne Number conſummate. So that the duall Number, as a noune adiectiue, ſtandeth naked without help of others. Therfore it is ioyned with the fift Number, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop it ſelfe the better: from which coniunction the ſeptinarie is framed. <hi>Macrobius</hi> referreth the one to the ſtarres, called <hi>Erratica,</hi> the other to the <hi>Zones:</hi> the one, by reaſon of his ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the other, from vertue of his Number. Hee ſticketh not to call this the firſt Number, taking <hi>Monade</hi> for a point, for no Number at all. For, ſaith hee, as a point is no bodie, but from it ſelfe maketh bodies: ſo is <hi>Monas</hi> no Number, but the beginning of Numbers. The firſt Number therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7836:16"/>to <hi>Macrobius</hi> Arithmetick, conſiſteth of two, which is like a line of a punct, produced vnder the doubleterme of a punct. Beeing therefore of ſmall force and efficacie, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendure cannot be ſo large as others be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee will beginne with the two Tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom <hi>Auſten</hi> writeth in this manner: <hi>What diſputations, what letters drawne from Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Fpiſtol 3. ad voluſia.</note> what Lawes of Cities are to be compared to thoſe two precepts of charitie, wherein Chriſt ſaid, that all the Lawe and Prophets did conſiſt? Heer are morall, logicall, and politicall counſels to be learned. Pythagoras</hi> rule, taught his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, conſiſteth of two; to learne how to ſpeak, and to knowe how to hold ones peace. The ſoule is compoſed of a twofold eſſence: The one, according to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> called indiuiduous, which <hi>Plato</hi> calleth intelligible, the other diuiduous, which he calleth ſenſitiue. There bee two parts in man; animall and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall; the one ſited in the heart, the other in the head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato</hi>'s diuiſion. There bee two ſenſes in mans body, interne and externe. The one appertaineth to the ſoule, and hath reaſon for his guide: the other goeth through all the parts of the body, ruling the things without the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſight and hearing is principall.</p>
               <p>There be two principall affections (called <gap reason="foreign">

There are two principall notices of things giuen vs from God, whence all philoſophy (as from a fountain) hath his beginning. The one called <hi>Ana</hi> in the Hebrew Tongue; whereby, from the inſtinct of nature, wee diſcerne good from euill; which the Doctors of the Church call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The other, whereby wee know truth from falſitie, called <hi>Conſcientia.</hi> The Art of Phyſick is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two parts; Theorique and practick. Aſtrologie conſiſteth of two; naturall, and coniecturall. Arithmetick is compoſed of two Numbers, <hi>Par</hi> and <hi>Impar,</hi> ſpoken of before. Muſick is either naturall or artificiall. Artificiall is compoſed of two Arithmick and metrick. There is a twofold life, actiue
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7836:16"/>and contemplatiue. By the one is figured <hi>Lea;</hi> by the other, <hi>Rachel.</hi> There be two aſtrologicall motions touching thoſe wandring Starres; the one from the Weſt to the Eaſt, the other from the Eaſt to the Weſt of the firſt Glo be,<note place="margin">Libel. contra aſtrologor. iudicia.</note> which is the firſt and ſwifteſt of all, according to <hi>Trapezontius.</hi> Hiſtorie contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two kindes of narrations; Thoſe that be fabulous, others that are ſerious. Others diuide it into that which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that which is hidden. Fabularie conſiſteth of two ſorts; either to ſhew a man pleaſure, as encomicall arguments; or by way of exhortation to deterre men from vice to vertue. The one feigneth an argument, as in <hi>Eſopes</hi> Fables; or expreſſeth truth vnder obſcenous ſpeeches, or by certaine poeticall fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or perchance couereth it vnder ſome vaile or morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, as antient philoſophers did.

By the firſt may bee ſignified the graue, or the time that the ſoule of man is ſeparated from the body. There are two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements giuen vs from God, wherin the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue conſiſteth, mentioned in our other Chapter; To loue God, and our neighbour as our ſelfe.

There are two Secrets among thoſe Cabaliſts: One that is a ſimple Secret; the other, a Secret, <hi>Cui non eſt ſimile,</hi> called the Secret of Secrets. The one is compounded of Art, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſdome, affection, power, habit of the minde, and ſo forth; The other from extaſie, voyce, inſpiration, viſion, and whatſoeuer is giuen vs from aboue. All the elements in the eight bodies of heauen (according to <hi>Iamblicus</hi>) after an heauenly manner, are found two times retrograde from their

                  </note> the other celeſtiall, according to that ſaying in <hi>Geneſis, Ecce Adam ſicut vnus ex nobis.</hi> Hee ſayd not, one like vnto you (ſpeaking vnto the Angels, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome <hi>Rabbines</hi> expoſition), but like vnto vs, making the ſecond Perſon in Trinity. For in the Angels there is a Number or alteritie, which you will. In vs (which is meant by Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>) there is infinite vnity, eternall,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7836:17"/>ſimple, abſolute. And yet grant there were vnitie in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (which ſome call imperfect), yet it cannot bee compared to that vnity which is in God. Therefore God neuer ſpake of the Angels there, when he ſpake of the Vnity,<note place="margin">Dici non poteſt quanto interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio creator a creatura ſit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus.

                  <hi>Primaſius,</hi> an antient Father, maketh a twofold diſtinction of penitence: The one, before Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Lib. de gratia at libero arburio.</note> which may bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a depriuation of Baptiſme; the other, after Baptiſme, by which our ſins are waſht away. There is a twofold Church; the militant, and triumphant: in the one, the faithfull dwell together with the wicked; in the other, the faithfull alone. Man, when he dieth, hath a twofold receptacle: his body paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into the earth, from whence it came; his ſoule, to heauen, from whence originally it deſcended. There is a twofould Book of life, of vocation, and election: wee may haue our names blotted out of the firſt, but not out of the laſt. Euery diſſolution of an argument conſiſteth in two; by diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, by improouing. By diſtinguiſhing, when fallacies of words are detected through ſome ambiguity and conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one, by co-operation or conjunction; the other, by equiuocation, many times through confuſion of Synonimies, diuerſity of diſtinctions; or laſtly, when the Principles bee quite differing from their <hi>Principiata,</hi> as we call them. Again, by improouing, two waies: Either from the Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by ſhewing the abſurdity of falſe Principles; or from reaſon, taken from authority; or by conuincing the leſſer au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the greater, which is frequent among Logicians. Euery Figure is either angular or circular. Thoſe two appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations vſed by thoſe Pythagoreans, <hi>Vnum</hi> and <hi>Bonum,</hi> may fitly bee called the two Names of God. Hee is called One, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the beginning of all things, as alſo the vnity of each Number; Good, becauſe hee is the end, reſt, and abſolute feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of all things. The water produceth two kindes of liuing things; birds and fiſhes. Euery point in the Line is twofold; ſtraight or circular, according to <hi>Ptolomey.</hi> There be two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt operations in the Whole, as touching celeſtiall bodies;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7836:18"/>Motion and Illumination. There be two motions; one that is a mans owne proper; the other, borrowed. There are two Starres beneficious vnto vs; <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The Art mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſiſteth of two things; Men and munition. Logick conſiſteth of two; Inuention and judgement. Two things are required in a ſouldier; Strength and diſcipline. Angels haue a twofold viſion; Matutine and Veſpertine. Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation was neceſſary for two reſpects: For the vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the creature and the Creator, for that it was needfull, that God ſhould become man for the full ſatisfaction of mans offenſe; which by man alone could not be ſatisfied. As there bee two Starres or Planets beneficious to vs: ſo there are two maleficious; <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> There be two kindes of exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; aride and humectall: according to <hi>Plato</hi>'s diuiſion of humours, craſſe and viſcoſius. Wherein our Alchymiſts doo ſomewhat agree, though ſome think the contrary: for, their Sulphur ſerueth in ſtead of that which is aride and dry: their quick-ſiluer ſtandeth for humid and viſcoſius; euen as by red wine they ſignifie bloud. Gold is of a twofold nature; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, being aſtrall, formall, volatle; corporall, being materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or fixe. To the making of that which we call, <hi>Aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> two things are required: The firſt is, that the gold be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latle, not able to be reduced to his firſt ſubſtance; the ſecond, that the ſpirit of wine be added to this, that both may be made volatle.</p>
               <p>He that will be skilfull in this Art, let him reade <hi>Paracelſus</hi> Book, called <hi>Theſaurus Alchymistarum,</hi> page 398.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7836:18"/>made, is called illuminant, which is made by connaturall <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> and this is not beatificous. The one commonly is called celeſtiall; the other, terreſtiall. There are alſo two tortures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the puniſhment of the ſoule, from their opinion; the one placed in the highermoſt; the other, in the lowermoſt world. Hell is taken two manner of wayes; for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the diuells carry hell continually about them; for the place of puniſhment, where the ſoules of the wicked are tormented. According to <hi>Phylo,</hi> there be two words, two reaſons, two mindes; one aboue vs, as the <hi>exemplar</hi> of our reaſon; the other, our owne reaſon it ſelfe. Naturall ſcience is occupied about two: either it handleth thoſe things which commonly are in the things themſelues; or thoſe things which ſeeme to bee, but are not. Some will haue the heauens compoſed of two elements, that is, from light and the water; others, from light and water permixed together. The art cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led canonick, conſiſting of harmonic, vſeth two kinds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; Monachorde &amp; Tetrachorde, conſiſting of twenty ſtrings, called <hi>Nerui,</hi> treated of by <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> But this is found in Organes onely percuſſorie, tenſile, inflatile. That part of Aſtrologie called Meteoroſcope, handleth two things; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſublimities, diſtance of Starres. There are two kindes of veynes, which are as conduits by which our meat is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed into the body. The one ſort make way to the heart: the other are deriued from thence. They which goe to the heart, are as miniſters, that they may conuey from the liuer to the heart, imperfect bloud; which the heart receiueth, and turneth into that which is abſolute and perfect. The other which come from the heart, prouide, that the juice concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, may bee diſtributed through all the parts of the body.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. THREE.</head>
               <p>THe Number of three is the firſt compoſite Number, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a multitude, of ſome; by our Arithmeticians, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie: his vertue and power is diffuſiue among all creatures. And it is a plentious Number, becauſe it is the fountaine and well-ſpring of all things productiue, the beginning of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, the continuance of all immutable ſubſtance, as in our third Chapter before was touched. By his multiplication with the vnity and dualtie, he bringeth forth <hi>Tetraclys,</hi> one of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> Principles, beeing no other then the <hi>Idea</hi> of all things created; conteyning one, two, and that which is infinite. Whereto adde foure; and they will make, by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue kinde of proceſſion, iuſt ſeauen: from ſeauen, by doubling of the ternarie Number, they will make tenne: And becauſe there is nothing without the compaſſe of tenne, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> moſt wiſely hath ſaid, that Number is the beginning of all things whatſoeuer. This is a Theologicall Number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnder this the Perſons of the Trinitie are liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.<note place="margin">Ex citatio. Nice. Cho. the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaur. ortho. fidei. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> For, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> teacheth vs, <hi>The vnitie beareth principality from it ſelfe: the dualtie ariſeth greater from the vbertie of matter and forme, whereby bodies are exiſtent. The Trinity is definite from his owne perfection. By one, is ſignified the co-vnion of the God-head; by the other, the two natures in Chriſt; by the laſt, the triplicity of Perſons.</hi> The firſt ternarie Number, according to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> exceederh the binarie, leſt the Diuinity ſhould be included in too narrow a roome, or ſhould diffuſe it ſelfe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque ad infinitum.</hi> Now, there is another reaſon why the Diuinitie ſhould extend it ſelfe vnto the third Number; becauſe, among all other Numbers, the ternarie expreſſeth the type of a balance moſt chiefly. But euery man knoweth, that a balance is the very ſymbole of equality. So that it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7836:19"/>commeth to paſſe, that the triple Number, beyond all others, occupieth the middle place betwixt both extremes, that it is both euen and vnchangeable: ſo that a man cannot perceiue any compoſition to ariſe out of this Number. But ſome will ask, Could not God repreſent himſelfe vnto vs without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being without compaſſe of all Number, infinite incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptible, incomprehenſible? I anſwer, Though God be one, yea, the vnitie it ſelfe, yet he hath diuerſe names; not which ſhew vnto vs his diuerſe eſſences, or deities, but his proprieties onely, iſſuing from him. Therefore it is holden a Maxime in Diuinity: <hi>Nil obſtet quo minus nomina numeralia in diuinis admittantur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paul.</hi> Sea. Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloped.</note>

And the reaſon is, as the ſaid <hi>Dioniſius</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Lib. de diui. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe it lieth hid in that hie and myſticall Diuinity, which in his owne ſubſtance ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſubſtance of all others by many furlongs.</hi> So that it is true which is left vs by that ancient writer: <hi>Vnum non cognoſcit Deum, niſi Deus.</hi> And againe: <hi>Nos non apprehendimus de ipſo, et de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatibus eius, niſi vniuorſalia; et haec pauciſſima.</hi> As this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by this fecundious multiplication, goeth beyond any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo doth his extendure ſtretch farre and wide. There are three Perſons in the Trinitie. Chriſt ſaith, He is the way, truth, and life. There are three that beare teſtimony in heauen; The Father, the Word, and the Spirit. This triplicitie is expreſſed in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Magnus, potens, terribilis:</hi> ſome expoſitors haue <hi>Reuerendus.</hi> By which is ſhewed, how great he was before the creation, in the creation, after the creation. There are three kindes of <hi>Principiata,</hi> or <hi>Entia,</hi> which you will. Some are workes or magnitudes,<note place="margin">Lib. de soelo.</note> according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Others dwell, and obſerue bodies and magnitudes. Tho
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7836:20"/>laſt are dominions and beginnings of habitants and keepers; which, for their noble actions, are ſtiled Olympian dwellings. For, as hee ſaith, <hi>Nobilioribus nobiliora et altiora attribuuntur. Orpheus</hi> maketh three beginnings; <hi>Iupiter, Iuno,</hi> and the Law. By <hi>Iupiter,</hi> hee vnderſtandeth the beginning of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the chiefeſt God; By <hi>Iuno, Iupiters</hi> bedfellowe, the mother of all things: For in one of his hymnes he writeth, <hi>Abſque te nihil diuinò vitae natura agnouit,</hi> and ſo forth; By the Law, natures confirmatiue, or diſtribution. Theſe Symboles haue ſome identitie with that of <hi>Plato,</hi> who putteth theſe three beginnings;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> Prince among thoſe Chymicks, maketh three beginnings of oylevitriolous, by the ſeparation of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, that is, <hi>Mercurie,</hi> or the ſpirit, from his oyle, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and ſalt (which in their tryade, make an vnitie): it is admirable to thinke, what effects, in the curing of all manner of calculous diſeaſes, it produceth. There be three kindes of worlds;<note place="margin">There are three things belonging to God; Honor, to the creator; Loue, to the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Feare, to the Iudge. There are three things due to our neighbour; Obedience, to our ſuperior; Concord, to our equall; well-doing, to our inferior.</note> Senſible, intelligible, architypall. The one is the receptacle of all quantitie; the other, of vertue; the laſt, of principality, drawne from the former diuiſion. Theſe three haue diuerſe reſpects: The one is circumſcriptiue; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, definitiue; the laſt, repletiue, becauſe there is the firſt, ſempeterne, and ſufficient good, whereby things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, are made incorruptible; temporall, eternall; diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, permanent and euerlaſting. By one, is ſignified God; by the ſecond, this that is viſible; by the third, the leſſer world. There is a threefold neceſſitie; Abſolute, which is from God; phyſicall, which gouerneth deſtiny; euentuall or conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. But I like the opinion of thoſe Academicks and Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks better, becauſe it is not ſo doubtfull, and it commeth neerer to our Chriſtian Religion. They make deſtiny to bee the ſole efficient cauſe of working in nature. Euerie creature
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7836:20"/>which is in the world, conſiſteth of three; Simple, as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and heauen; incorporeall, as the ſpirits; compoſed,<note place="margin">There are three things belonging to our ſelues; Cleanneſſe of heart, ſilence of our tongue, chaſtiſement or gouernment of our bodie.</note> as man. All kinde of Planetarean traiections are of three kindes; ſwift, ſudden, momentane. There bee three great heauens; Chryſtalline, Empireous, and the Firmamentall. Fire hath three properties; To conſume, to incinerate, and to draw to his owne likenes ſuch things as are neer vnto it. Againe, it is penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, communicatiue, diuiſiue. Aire hath threefold qualities. It is ſubtile, mobile, perſpicuous. Quick-ſiluer is of a tripled diſpoſition. Some will haue it cold; others, hot; ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, temperate, that is, hot and cold. The Starres haue three proper names. Some are called retrograde; ſome, progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue; others, ſtationarie. The ſect of phyſicians is threefold; Empirick, found out by <hi>Philinus Coos,</hi> Prince of that ſect; methodicall, brought into a <hi>Compendium</hi> by <hi>Themiſon Laodiceus</hi> the Syrian; rationall, made perſect by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There bee three affections beſides nature; The cauſe, preceding the diſeaſe; the diſeaſe, by which the action is firſt corrupted; Symptomies, which follow the diſeaſe. Diſeaſes happen commonly in three parts of the body; In the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie parts, in the inſtrumentall, in both of them. The firſt is called a morbous diſpoſiture, where the firſt qualities or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deflect ſomething from their naturall ſymmetrie. The ſecond is an euill conſtitution, which ſome tearme an officiall diſeaſe. The third is a diſſolution of vnity and continuity. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie purging medicament, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Rule, muſt conteyne theſe three qualities: It muſt worke quickly, ſafely, pleaſingly. There are three theologicall vertues; three <hi>Charites;</hi> three kindes of Councells; generall, prouinciall, Epiſcopall, according to <hi>Canus</hi> diuiſion. There bee three regions of the ayre; That which is loweſt and neereſt to the earth, beeing hot and cold; that which is compoſed of raine, ſnowe, haile, which is cold and moiſt; the laſt participating of thoſe higher bodies, called The higheſt region, which is hot. There are three exhalations, or impreſsions of the ayre, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Myzaldus.</hi> That part of aſtrologie wee call Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, comprehendeth three things; The <hi>intercapedines</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7836:21"/>Sunne, Moone and Starres. The Aſtrolabe inuented by <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> (if wee beleeue <hi>Syneſius,</hi> for ſome will haue it not ſo anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) appertaineth to this ſcience. Ciuill gouernment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of three; <hi>Regnum, Optimates, Reſpub:</hi> Her exceſſe conteyneth three likewiſe; <hi>Tyrannie, Oligarchie, Democracie. Plato</hi> diuides it into three, as the ſoule of man. By reaſon, he intimateth philoſophers; by anger, ſouldiers; by couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, artificers. The art Optick is diuided into three: One ſearcheth out the cauſe of viſible things, which through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of diſtance are thought vntrue; as, when lines alternall doe concurre among themſelues, and thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate angles are intercepted. The ſecond, called Catoptick, is occupied about inflexions altogether. The third, called Scenographie, diſcerneth by what meanes abnumerous and deformious things may be feined in Images; which are ſeene, for their diſtance and altitudes ſake. Some part of it vſeth lines and angles concerning the ſight, proiections of beames, ſhadowes, figurations of light, glaſſes, planes, globous, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnarie, turbinall, hollow, conuex, and ſo forth; treated of by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itruvius</hi> and others. Our ſtile wee write with (eſpecially in an hiſtory) ought to bee fuſe, contimuous, peryodicall. There is a threefold habitacle of the ſoule; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, ſpirituall, earthly, prefigured vnto vs (if wee beleeue thoſe antient <hi>Magi</hi>) by their threefold veſtiment, made of linnen, woollen, leather; which <hi>Adam</hi> made him, after hee was thruſt out of Paradiſe. <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> dreamed of a threefold Faſt, in theſe words: <hi>Adhuc tres diesſacrificabitis, et non vltra.</hi> By which, ſome goe about to interprete the comming of our Sauiour to the laſt Iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> an antient Aſtronomer, attributeth to the Sunne, three ſphears; to the Moone, as many. The firſt carrieth the South-pole, from the Eaſt into the Weſt, by a diurnall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſecond driueth the South from the Weſt into the Eaſt vnder the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> according to his longitude, from one ſigne into another; and it is called the motion of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The third carrieth the South from the Weſt into the Eaſt, vnder the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> according to his latitude, as the South declineth from the Ecclyptick: and this is called the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7836:21"/>motion of latitude. <hi>Philo</hi> vſeth three words, by which are declared many ſymboles; Image, Abſciſion, Eradiation. But theſe, beeing well vnderſtood, are no other then a ſymbole with that Chaldean; proprietie, with <hi>Salomon;</hi> image, with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> delibation, with <hi>Cicero:</hi> where hee faith, <hi>Animos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros hauſtos et delibatos ex diuinitate.</hi> And in his Tuſculane queſtions hee ſpeaketh more clearely: <hi>Humanos animos decerpi ex mente diuind;</hi> Making indeed (which is admirable in an heathen Philoſopher) the diuine minde (which is God) the Originall of our ſoule. Theſe heauenly bodies are three in Number; Shining, as the Sunne; not ſhining, as other Starres and Planets, hauing but a borrowed light; Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or tranſparant, as all the celeſtiall Sphears. There be three things which make the intention of heat; The greatnes of light, denſitie, and propinquitie. The mouing of the Starres differs three manner of wayes: From their motion ſwifter or flower, for that ſome haue more need of waight then others haue; from the ſite of that region wherein they are moued. The circles of the Sunne haue three different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations; ſtreight, locall, oblique: the Greekes call them <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diackes;</hi> the Latines, Signifers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> holds, that grace conſiſteth in three things: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of things paſt, contempt of things preſent, deſire of things to come. God made the world by willing, vnderſtanding, by his immutable counſell: in which there wanteth nothing towards the workmanſhip thereof, beauty, and perfection. Though there bee three Perſons in the Trinity, equall in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, maieſty and power; yet the Sonne is rather the Image of his Father, than the holie Ghoſt, according to the opinion of ſome Diuines. There are three diſtinctions of intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The firſt conteyneth the Cherubin, in the goodnes of the Almighty; the Seraphin, in his veritie and eſſence; Thrones, in his Wiſdome and equity. The ſecond hath Dominations, commanding that which others are to doe; principalities, caring for publique matters, as heads of the people, and ſuch as reſiſt the power of others, who oppoſe themſelues againſt the Law of God.

There is a threefold mobility in Angels; Of nature, intelligence, will: Of nature, becauſe euery thing creaeed, turneth into nothing, if it bee not guided by the hand of Gods omnipotencie; Of vnderſtanding, reaching vnto the knowledge of things, and ſuch as they ſhall vtter; Of will, becauſe they will not doe this and that at one inſtant. There is a threefold Hierarchie; Superceleſtiall, in the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; celeſtiall, in the order Angelicall; terreſtriall, in men. Angels haue a threefold knowledge of things; in the Word, in themſelues, in the viſion of the Almighty. Their ſtate is threefold; Of innocency, of grace, of glory.

               <p>The earth hath three appellations; animall, vegetall, minerall. It hath three vertues or properties. It is the matter whereby wee were firſt created; the mother of all things; the trueſt phyſick, as touching our reſtauration and conſeruation. Hee that knoweth himſelfe, knoweth all things in himſelfe; God, vnto whoſe likenes hee was made; the world, whoſe image hee beareth; all the creatures, with whom hee ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth. Mans dignity conſiſteth in three things; In that God made him a reaſonable creature, innocent in his life, potent in his dominion. Man hath a threefold eie; Of the fleſh, whereby hee ſeeth the world; of reaſon, whereby hee ſeeth

Chriſts natiuitie is threefold; diuine, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, of his owne accord: the firſt, from his Father; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by his Mother; the laſt, by his will. There appeared his benignitie and humanity at his natiuity, from a threefold receptacle: From the boſome of his Father, wherein hee lay hid; from the ſhadow of the Law, wherein he was figured; from the belly of his mother, wherein hee was formed.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7836:22"/>There is a threefold ladder of nature, wherein three regions of triplicity, and in euery of them one ſtate of abſtraction is conſidered. The firſt is the obiect tranſparant, and the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or phantaſie. The ſecond is the interior ſenſe, phantaſie, and brutiſh iudgement; The third, humane iudgement, reaſon, and vnderſtanding: of all which, the minde is Lady and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe. There bee three principall meanes or wayes, whereby wiſdome, or the knowledge of all things hath beene deriued vnto vs. The firſt, anon after the creation of the world, by tradition, diſperſed through a great many of nations; which, if it had not beene violated, would haue beene found more profitable vnto mankinde. The ſecond, by thoſe Philoſophers, who ſearched curiouſly after the nature and cauſes of things. The third hath lightned all kinde of nations and countries with his claritie, diſperſing the miſt of naturall reaſon and Philoſophie, by his ſunne-ſhining beames; which is worthy the name of wiſdome, becauſe it commeth from the fountaine of wiſdome, conteyned in the old and new Teſtament. Thoſe diuine perſonalities are three in Number, and haue diuerſe operations: The power of the Father producing all things, giuing to euery man his vnity; The wiſdome of the Sonne diſpoſing all things, vniting and copulating them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The loue of the holy Ghoſt conuerting all things to GOD, tying the whole worke to his Maker, by the band of charitie.</p>
               <p>There are three faculties of the body. One is Animall, which, from the braine, paſſeth vnto the nerues, as through certaine pipes, tranſmitting ſenſe and motion vnto all the parts of the body, and nouriſhing the vnderſtanding. The other is vitall; which, from the heart vnto the arteries, as by certaine chanells, giueth life vnto the whole body.

                  </note> Howſoeuer, it cannot chuſe but be a Number of multiplications, power, and veneration; ſeeing, of all the Numbers which are leſſe then tenne, it conſiſteth of his owne parts: For, it includeth a medietie, a third and ſixt part; and he is the third medietie, the third part of two, the ſixt part of one: all which, joyntly or ſeuerally, make but ſixe in the whole. Hee hath other tokens of venerable eſtimation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Theologicall Number, bearing the type of the worlds creation. Now, the ſixt dayes-worke, according to ſome Theologiſts, is no otherwiſe then a repreſentation of the <hi>Triſagium,</hi> called the Trinity: which ſome interprete out of theſe words in the Pſalme; <hi>Dies dici eructat verbum, et nox nocti indicat ſcientiam.</hi> And againe, according to the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint tranſlation; <hi>In capite libri ſcriptum eſt de me.</hi> Whoſoeuer hath expounded that concerning the ſixt dayes-worke, hath not taught amiſſe, if we dare beleeue <hi>Nicetas Choniates.</hi> For, the head and beginning of that Booke, that is, of the whole Scripture diuinely inſpired vnto vs (to ſpeake with Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) is the ſixt daies-work figured to vs by this Number; by which the whole Fabrick of the world was created. From whoſe greatnes and ſuperexcellencie, the Creator is worthily to bee praiſed and adored. But ſome Diuines will auerre, that God made not the world in ſix diſtinct dayes (as ſome imagine) but in one day, diſtinctly repreſenting ſix ſeuerall things. I anſwere, that this Text of Scripture, whereon theſe men ſeem ſo much to build, muſt not be vnderſtood ſo, as that wee muſt take the dayes according as they note the diſtinction of times:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7836:32"/>for, God (as I haue often proued in this diſcourſe) had no need of time, dayes, nor yeeres, to finiſh his begunne work; but according to the works of perfection, which is ſignified and compleated by the Number of ſix, orderly diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many ſeuerall and limited parts. For, whether he made it in ſix dayes, according to hourly or daily computation, or framed it all in one day, diuiding his work into ſix parts, it is all one for the venerable eſteeme and antiquity of the ſixt Number: It is enough for vs to know, that in the creation of the world, compleated in ſix parts, or ſix whole dayes, <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ALL Numbers, being doubled, muſt needs be of great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy; it being ſo almoſt in euery other thing.

                  </gap>; which, with their altitude impoſed vpon them, make a form of a Cube, which is no other than a ſolid body. So that the Geometricians doo hold, that twice two make foure; and twice foure, making eight, make a double
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7836:37"/>ſolid body; as well as three times three, which is nine, or three times nine, making 27 in the whole, do make the other cube a ſolid body. Wherefore this Number and the ſeuenth (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are reſembled to perfect and compleated men full of yeers, worthy to gouern a Common-wealth) haue been thought worthy, by thoſe Antients, to make the ſoule of the world perfect and correſpondent. His extendure is not the greateſt, nor the leaſt.</p>
               <p>There bee eight Sphears allowed by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle. Macrobius</hi> ſubſcribeth vnto them; and he ſeemeth to mee to gather the excellency of this Number from thoſe eight. Our later Wits haue found out two others, mentioned before. The laſt of theſe, according to the probable opinion of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, is moued from the Eaſt into the Weſt by a diurnall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ninth, added to thoſe eight, is volued with the tenth; and by his owne motion contrariwiſe endeauoureth towards the ecclyptick line and poles of the Zodiack, which ſpaceth for an hundred yeers together in one degree: and for this cauſe hee is called ſtern and hard to bee perceiued. The eightth is volued from the South to the North by his owne motion; firſt, for his vnequall; next, for his ſlowe; laſtly, for his ſwift paſe. Other reaſons amongſt Aſtronomers I omit. Then be eight puniſhments appointed offenders, mentioned by <hi>Cicero;</hi> Loſſe, bands, ſtripes, talion, ignominy, baniſhment, death, bondage. Which haue ſome reſemblance to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of hell, vſed by our School-men: for they hold, that it is taken two manner of waies. For the puniſhment: and ſo diuels carry hell about them ſtill: or for the place of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo it is taken either for the puniſhment of ſenſe or loſſe, where is darknes without and within, that is, abſence of grace (for, this hath alwaies mourning, as the Text ſaith); or for puniſhment of ſenſe and loſſe both together, including darknes without and within; or for puniſhment of loſſe, and not ſenſe, concluding darknes without, but not the ſame darknes which priueth vs of grace.

For, thoſe whom the Philoſophers call gods of nations, the Hebrew Rabbines numerations, we Chriſtians call Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; which amount to eight in the whole. That which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> means by <hi>Pallas,</hi> the ſame we attribute to GOD for his wiſdome. That which the Philoſophers by <hi>Mercury,</hi> the ſame we ſignifie by his vnderſtanding.

So that it is thought, that many of thoſe Heathen Theologiſts, though they aſcribed many names to their gods, yet they worſhipped but one true God: or, at leaſtwiſe, wee may think them to be but Apes, following the ſteps of diuinity as neer as nature would permit them; ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing with the Chriſtians in many things, if they bee well vnderſtood For, calling them gods of nations, or leſſer gods, with the Philoſophers, wee mean not that they haue equall power with God, or that they were to be worſhipped, as our Papiſts (bending at this day too much to Paganiſm) will haue their he-gods and ſhe-gods. No; we mean vertues, or certain kinde of operations, as ſo many celeſtiall radiations or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams proceeding from that infinite and vniuerſall ſplendor of wiſdome. And this did many of thoſe wiſer and ſounder Philoſophers think, howſoeuer they couered their doctrine

So that if a threefold cord can hardly bee broken, becauſe of his vnited and auxiliarie vigor; then much more theſe three cords, ioyned with ſix more, are vnreſiſtible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Philoſopher, <hi>Vis vnita fortior.</hi> That this Number, from the opinion of Geometricians, carrieth no ſmall diuinity, hath beene ſhewed already out of <hi>Macrobius,</hi> for that his maruellous triplicity maketh a cube or a ſolid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now, euery ſolid body conſiſteth of a threeſold dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, longitude, latitude, and profundity, which is the perfection or <hi>Idea</hi> of ſolidity. So that a ſolid Number is as well compoſed of the vnequall, as of the equall quality, eſpecially if they bee doubled or trebbled. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: The Geometricians doe hold, that foure-times two, which is eyght in the whole, beeing an equall Number, make a ſolid body. Euen ſo three-times three (whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is <hi>Monas</hi>) and three-times nine, conſiſting of an vnequall Number, produce a threefold dimenſion, which is a ſolid body. His extendure is as large as ſome of the other.</p>
               <p>There are nine Muſes ſignified vnder this word <hi>Mucmoſune,</hi> conteyning nine elements in the whole. Whereupon <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> calleth this a moſt perfect Number;<note place="margin">Poet. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

Againe, the Antients erred in this, in that they called this, The Number of the heauens. For, there were but eight in thoſe daies when they liued: how then could the ninth agree with them? This of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> by way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,

Then they grewe from foure to ſeuen, from ſeuen to nine. And why might it not be ſo with the Number of the heauens, ſeeing <hi>Calius Rodignie</hi> auerreth, that they were nine at the firſt; and afterwards, by later inuention, they grew to the Number of tenne: euen as that inſtrument called <gap reason="foreign">

There be nine kindes of conſtitutions out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len;</hi> One temperate, or mediocrous, in which all the qualities ſerue, according to equilibrious proportion; eight are intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate: in which, one or two excell the reſt; from whence foure ſimples, that is, hot and cold; foure compounds, that is, hot and dry, hot and moyſt, cold and dry, cold and moyſt, are deriued.

If therefore Angells, co helpers and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiutors to man, are not to be praied vnto; much leſſe any saint of Heauen: who though they enioy a place not much inferior to thoſe Angels, and are made fellow heires with Chriſt in one and the ſelfe-ſame Kingdome, yet this muſt bee imputed to Chriſt, not to their owne righteouſneſſe; beeing ſometimes men on earth as we are, ſubject to the like infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as we be; and ſo ſhall remaine, vntill Chriſt, with his glorious mantle of righteouſnes, ſhall couer our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes. Therefore ſuch manner of Numbers, giuing ſo much to Angels, whereby the leaſt jot of Gods glory, dominion, orpower, may ſeeme to bee empeached, ought warily and diſcreetly to be read.

                     </gap>, Picus,</hi> and <hi>Galatinus.</hi> The firſt is as touching thoſe two places; Paradiſe and Hell: for, they all hold, that there is a twofold place appointed vnto man for his twofold condition and reward; corporall and ſpirituall. The one is called An illuminating ſpeculation, that is, vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating: the School-men call it An intuitiue knowledge of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7836:42"/>God; which accompanieth the ſoule ſeparated from the body by the light of glory; which, to them that earneſtly ſeek after heauenly things, is onely beatificous. The other containeth an illuminating kinde of viſion, but no contemplation; which is made by <hi>Species</hi> connaturall, and is not accounted bleſſed. The one is heauenly; the other, terreſtriall. The Rabbines hold, eſpecially <hi>Raban Gernudenſis</hi> on <hi>Exodus,</hi> that a man ſhall neuer be made capable of the firſt intuition, before the ſoule is ſeparated from the body. If at any time, ſay they, GOD bee ſaid to be ſeen of man, that is, with any corporeall ſenſe, it is done by an Angell, and not otherwiſe. It ſeemeth, that theſe Rabbines, maintaining this doctrine of a twofold place, knew nothing of a third, which is their Popiſh Purgatory. They muſt therefore go to <hi>Plato</hi> and his Followers for their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Purgatory, or elſe it will not bee found <hi>in rerum naturâ.</hi> The ſixt is concerning the communication of the world: for, man being called <gap reason="foreign">

Now, the ſupreme world, with that third incomparable and ſuper-ſupreme, communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſoule of <hi>Meſſihas,</hi> as beeing an eſſence between them both, conſociable with the Angelicall and diuine world.

Hence comes it, that there is a corporeall world; which, firſt, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the heauens, and heauenly bodies; ſecondly, of the elements, and things elementary; thirdly, of the nature of man, and of ſingular men, which is man, the leſſer world; which beeing animated, is illuſtrated with his owne proper minde, which is called <hi>Metratton.</hi> Now, the ſupreme world conſiſteth of ſeparated intelligences, full of <hi>Species</hi> and forms, including ſoluted mindes and Angels: of thoſe Symboliſts it is called, <hi>Idea ideata omnium vitarum;</hi> vnto which is referred all kinde of indiuiduall vitality, ſpecificous or generificous. The third is of the Deity, which is made of that which they call <hi>Seraphin.</hi> In <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> he is called Thrice holy. Of this

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7836:45"/>without any order or partition, many times not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a right ſignification, according to their worth and dignity, perchance huddling them together all in a heape, without note and diſtinction, ſlightly or perfunctorily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them ouer. In this Chapter therefore, according to our module, wee will intreat of all their kindes, ſignifications, vertues, extendures, not omitting any one noted by others, to haue the leaſt repreſentation of vertue, myſtery, diuinity included in him. Firſt wee, will beginne with the twelfth Number.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo remarkable in this, as the twelue ſignes.

Wherein nothing is omitted as touching the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and fabrick of that vaſt and monſtrous body, from grounds of Anatomy, nothing belonging to their ſignes, from rules of Aſtronomy. So that if I haue fitted them with curious points out of Theology, Aſtrology, Anatomy, Phyſick, and Metaphyſicall Phyloſophy, beyond their expectation; I hope they will aſcribe it to the few houres and dayes I haue ſpent in the Art of Numbring.<note place="margin">The Kings of <hi>France</hi> (if wee beleeue <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Siſellius</hi>) haue vſually twelue choſen Counſellors of State about them.</note> This Number is not without his exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, anſwerable to his dignity.</p>

                  </note> according to the Symbole of that learned Cardinall. <hi>Moſes</hi> tooke the Law vpon mount <hi>Sina,</hi> for forty dayes. Chriſt, in forty houres, went away Conqueror ouer heauen, earth, and hell. <hi>Helias,</hi> fed with one morſell of bread, came in forty dayes to the Mount of <hi>Oreb.</hi> Chriſt, fed with the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Croſſe, after forty houres expired, came from darknes to life againe. Chriſt againe did faſt forty dayes in the deſart, and ouercame Satan. Now, for the further explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this; ſome hold, that the ſoule of Chriſt remained ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his body forty houres, taking them from three dayes: For, he ſuffered about the vernall Equinoct, that is, at that time when the dayes and nights are of one length; and about the middle of the day he let goe his ſpirit. So that hee died ſix houres before the Sunne went downe: becauſe, in the time of the Equinoctiall, if the day haue twelue houres, the middle of the day hath ſix before Sunne-ſet. He was buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the completorie houre, that is, about the going downe of the Sunne. He ſtaied in his Sepulcher an whole night going before the Sabbath day, and the whole day of the Sabbath, which contayne in them twenty foure houres. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning going before the Dominicall day, which was the third day of his death, he roſe againe. The morning goeth for two houres before the Sunne riſeth. So that wee muſt beleeue, his body remained in the graue on that third day, for the ſpace of tenne houres. Now, ſix houres of the day of his death, and twenty foure of the whole Sabbath day, make full thirty. Adde tenne houres more of the night following the third day, and they make vp iuſt fotty. Therefore the ſoule of Chriſt was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his body for the ſpace of forty houres, that is, ſix before his buriall, and after that, thirty foure. But in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (which cannot be done without exact Numbring) we muſt obſerue one ſingular Note; How that the Euangeliſts, attributing the ſpace of Chriſts death to the Ablatiue ſenſe,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7836:47"/>will not haue whole dayes meant heereby, but part of whole dayes. By this wee may learne, how needfull the vſe of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is, to the right vnderſtanding of diuers paſſages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether they be doctrinall, or hiſtoricall.</p>
               <p>Now, in Chronologie, or iuſt ſupputation of yeeres, that is, to knowe how long thoſe antient Kings mentioned in Scripture, did raigne, there is nothing ſo needfull as the Art of Numbring. And if you marke it well, in all their ſeuerall Raignes or Regiments, no Number occurreth ſo often as the fortith Number; as though God had appointed vnder this Number, the whole race or period of their kingly ſucceſſion to haue beene concluded and determinated. As for example: <hi>Moſes</hi> gouerned forty yeeres; <hi>Othoniel,</hi> 40; <hi>Barac</hi> and <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> 40; <hi>Gedeon,</hi> 40; the Philiſtins <hi>interregnum</hi> conſiſted of 40. <hi>Saul, Dauid,</hi> raigned as many; which I haue collected from the computation of <hi>Canus,</hi>

In <hi>Geneſis</hi> we finde it written, <hi>Ipſe conteret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Serpentis;</hi> referred to the ſeed of the woman, and not to the woman herſelf, as ſome Popiſh Interpreters will haue it. This was, ſure, an happy promiſe made, repreſenting the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary Number, being vttered in ſo many words. For, Chriſt, which was the ſeed of the woman, hath plaid the Conquerer, foure manner of waies: By freeing vs from originall ſinne, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> both were firſt polluted; by breaking the ſnares of Satan, who had tempted them; by triumphing ouer the power of hell; by trampling death and his ſting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet. This quadruple bleſſing, beeing a pledge of his promiſe made to our firſt parents, could not chuſe but bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them and their poſterity. The Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> for the confirmation of this promiſe, in his ſalutation vnto the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> ſpake two words, more powerfull, more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, more remarkable in their few elements, than of euery man can be well vnderſtood. What are thoſe? <hi>Aue Maria;</hi> containing the binarie Number, euery letter almoſt including within it ſome ſecret myſterie. Which no man doth better expound, than that antient Father <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in this ſimilitude: <hi>As</hi> Eue <hi>was ſeduced by an Angelicall Speech</hi> (hee meaneth,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. vlt.</note> the temptation of that Serpent), <hi>whereby ſhe might flee from GOD, hauing preuaricated his Word: ſo this</hi> Eue, <hi>by the Angels ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was euangelized, whereby ſhe might bear Chriſt, being obedient to the Word. And as the one was tempted to forſake GOD: ſo the other was perſwaded to obey GOD; that one Virgin might be the others Aduocate. And as mankinde was ſubiect to death by the means of a Virgin: ſo it was reſtored again by a Virgin; the virginall inobedience of the one beeing equally poized with the virginall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the other.</hi> Now, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath not onely alluded to the Angels ſalutation, by calling her Bleſſed, but vnto the bare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, aſwell typically to be vnderſtood; wherein this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was deliuered: for, <hi>Aue,</hi> by inuerſion of the letters, is <hi>Eua.</hi> As then the firſt <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> by preuaricating God's Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, did flee from the face of God: ſo the ſecond, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt in her womb, and being made obedient vnto the Word (for, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> muſt not otherwiſe be vnderſtood), hath been a principall means or inſtrument to reconcile vs again to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7836:48"/>God, which was Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> For, whereas hee ſaith, that the ſecond <hi>Eue</hi> was made an Aduocate for the firſt, it is meant, that her obedience to the Word, was acceptable before God, bearing him in her womb, that ſhould be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of his people; that as by the diſobedience of the one, ſin entred into the world: ſo, by the obedience of the other, an vniuerſall reſtauration ſhould be looked for again. So that if any thing were admirable and praiſe-worthy in that virgin, to make her an Aduocate for the other (to vſe <hi>Irenaeus</hi> word), it was ſurely her obedience to the Word ſpoken by the angell, conjoyned with a liuely faith, that ſhe ſhould bear a Sauiour; and no otherwiſe. I could inſiſt vpon many others of this kinde; as, The bleſſing beſtowed vpon <hi>Abraham, In ſemine tuo benedicentur omnes nationes;</hi> the ſong of the three children prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Lord in the fiery furnace; the Song of <hi>Simeon;</hi> the Farwell of <hi>Stephen,</hi> couched in theſe ſeuen words,<note place="margin">Som will haue the 7 words that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpake at his departure, to ſignifie thoſe 7 heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſhined in him.</note>

But, leauing them, we will come to thoſe words of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the moſt happy, moſt courageous and triumphant conflict that euer was endured ſince the world began. Neither doe I think, that thoſe words were vttered by any kinde of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as ſome imagine; but rather from inuincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and magnanimity, if a famous and learned Cardinall of Rome, in his expoſition, deceiue mee not. That which I am to inſiſt vpon, as eſpecially ſeruing my purpoſe, are thoſe two Hebrew words, <hi>Eli Eli;</hi> containing the duall Number in form as they lie, but in their proper ſignification repreſenting the two Perſons in Trinity; making this parcell of Scripture (to the vnfolding of which, many learned men haue imployed their wits) to be farre otherwiſe vnderſtood, than the bare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements ſeem to import. Now, becauſe this Cardinals expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (as ſeemeth to me) wreſteth not the ſenſe of Scripture, but fitteth my purpoſe; and, of all others that euer I read, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out moſt liuely the victory of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, I thought it good, word for word, to ſet down as followeth.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:7836:49"/>
               <p>After he had repeated the words of Chriſt expreſſed by the Euangeliſt, thus he commenteth: <hi>If our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was not forſaken; if he fell not from the ſtrength of his minde; if not from hope; if he knew aſſuredly, that his ſoule ſhould not be left of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, but ſhould be ioyned with his body again; if he left his momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life willingly, it is not fit that Christ ſhould vtter thoſe words in any lamentable ſort, My God, my God, and ſo forth. And therefore I think beer lies a myſtery;<note place="margin">Marcus Vigeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> which I had rather bear and learn, than expreſſe or teach: yet I will ſay ſomething, not far from our Sauiours meaning, as I think. Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was the Sonne of God, and trui God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, God with the Father, God with the holy Ghoſt; all three as one God, and by that vnion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impartible, indiuiſible, and wholly inſeparable the one from the other: and yet the Son ſuffred on the Croſſe; not the Father, nor the holie Ghoſt. When the work of our redemption was taken wholly in the Perſon of the Son, all three together, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, worked. All three appeared in his natinity. The Sonne was born alone. His peregrination, his doctrine, his miracles, his Paſſion, his death following, all three worked and effected: the Son alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. This myſtery, this ineffable Sacrament, this inacceſſible Secret hid in darknes, the Lord Ieſus would haue open by theſe words; that if we may not aſcend to the ſame wholly, yet in part wee may learn with ſobriety and trembling. My God, my Father, my God, my holy Spirit, who hitherto haue laboured in all things with me, but I only haue ſuffred all things; wherefore haue you forſaken me, and are now ſeparted from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ee in bearing this Croſſe? So that theſe words of Christ ſhewed forth the magnitude of his minde, and no fear at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto that Cardinall, out of his book cald <hi>Decachordum Chriſtianum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Scape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the old Teſtament, hath cuer been accounted a figure of the Paſſion of Chriſt.</note> written vpon the life and Paſſion of Chriſt. To whoſe words may be added, for the further explaining of this ſecret Symbole; As a man, that, in the midſt of his enemies, being forſaken of his friends, fighteth the more valiantly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope of victory: ſo Chriſt, in this agony hiding his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or laying it aſide for a time, forſaken of his two friends that ſo long had worked with him (God the Father, and God the holy Ghoſt), all alone, and in his owne proper perſon, did manfully and victoriouſly vndergoe the terrors of death. So that whether we conſider the word <hi>Eli,</hi> from his tripled ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7836:49"/>repreſenting the whole Trinity, or the word doubled, expreſſing but two perſons, the Father and holy Ghoſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but ſtirre vs to an exceeding admiration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, as often as we reade them; but far more, if from our dull ſenſes and feeble vnderſtanding, wee were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. I muſt confeſſe, that the Cardinalls doctrine ſeemeth directly oppoſite to the common torrent of ſome Engliſh Diuines: but my proteſtation is not to ouer ſway the opinions of others better learned then my ſelfe, to build my faith (which is the anchor of a Chriſtian man) vpon the fancie-full opinion of any priuate man. Onely this I muſt ſay by way of iuſt defenſe, that hee was learned, religious, exceeding deuout, from whom I borrowed it. Who although hee ſauour Popiſhly affected, by reaſon of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thoſe times he liued in, yet he is nothing ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly giuen as many of his fellowes were.</p>
               <p>Their doctrine then, who maintaine that Chriſt vpon the Croſſe did ſuffer paines of the damned and reprobate, ſeemeth very harſh to me. And I would haue them take heed,<note place="margin">Al the Fathers doe ſpeake but of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſufferings, If therefore one drop of his bloud was enough for the redemption of mankinde, much more ſo many ſtreames of bloud iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all the partes of his body, as if it had beene a precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that whereas Chriſt at his natiuity, his circumciſion, in all his works and miracles he did in his life time, was both God and Man; vpon the Croſſe, and in his Paſſion, by a ſtrange kinde of diuinity, neuer dreamed of in the Primitiue Church, he ſhould ſhew himſelfe leſſe then a God, leſſe then a man. From Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if wee goe to ſtories of the Church, plenty of happie Numbers will be found. The moſt antient and of greateſt moment, is that which was ſpoken from heauen to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperour, when hee fought againſt the Tyrant <hi>Maxentius</hi> in theſe words, <hi>In hoc Signo vinces.</hi> Which foure elements haue no ſmall vertue and admiration included in them, portending more intrinſically, then extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically they ſeeme. For as there was viſibly ſeene a forme of the Croſſe in the element: ſo the figure of this Croſſe is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the foure words vttered, which doth make the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and wonder of it far greater then outwardly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
               <p>This figure therefore of the Croſſe (that I may vnfold ſo great a myſtery) of all others is the ſtraighteſt, conteining
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7836:50"/>foure ſtraight Angles, according to thoſe foure elements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding from heauen. And it is the firſt deſcription of that we call <hi>Superficies,</hi> hauing both longitude and latitude, which ſome auerre to be corroborated with thoſe heauenly powers, becauſe their ſtrength reſulteth by the rectitude of Angles and beames. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the Starres are then moſt potent, when, in a celeſtiall forme, they obtaine foure corners,<note place="margin">They that ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues enemies to this antient and venerable ſigne, being no other then a badge or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of our Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, will become ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt who ſuffered vpon this Croſſe.</note> and by proiection of their beames one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, doe make a Croſſe. Which alſo hath great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with the quinarie, ſeptenarie, and nouenarie Number. Therefore among the Arabes (men that were curious in the ſearch of high myſteries) the ſigne of the Croſſe was had in no ſmall admiration, as beeing a moſt firme receptacle of all manner of heauenly intelligences. Other Numbers I count vnhappy, which by their expoſition doe ſignifie or portend ſome fatall calamity to men. As, in Scripture we haue <hi>Mans, Tekel, Phares,</hi> ſpoken to <hi>Balthazar:</hi> which, expreſſed in three Hebrew elements containing the ternary Number, did (no doubt) ſignifie vnto him a threefold calamity or downfall; The ruine of his Kingdome, the ſacking of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the letting-in the riuer Euphrates for the paſſage of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his hoaſt, as a iuſt puniſhment denounced againſt him for his threefold ſinne and wickednes; Pride, Idolatry, drunkenneſſe. Of this kinde there will be found many in Scripture; as, Chriſts word denounced againſt Hicruſalem, thoſe which he ſpake to the rich man; <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Demas; Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> the holy Ghoſt in the Apocalypſe, to the Church of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> which all contayne ſome inward ſecrecy of Numbers, parted from their elements, or which, without exact calculation both of words and letters, may not be well vnderſtood. So that ſuch kind of Numbers, as theſe be, may be called tacite or implicite, becauſe they bee not properly taken for Numbers, except the words or elements are diuided from each other, wherein they are ſecretly or incluſiuely touched. The laſt Number I meane to inſiſt vpon, is out of the Apocalypſe, included in the word <hi>Lateinos;</hi> A word of ſuch hidden and impenetrable myſtery, that ſince Saint <hi>Iohn's</hi> time that did vtter it, it is a thouſand and ſix hundred yeeres, and yet among ſome it is hardly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7836:50"/>Yes, this word of all others hath frighted the B. of Rome more &amp; his miniſters, then the D. of <hi>Bourbon</hi> did, when he and his ſouldiers ſeazedvpon the city of Rome, made his Holineſs to intrench himſelf in his caſtle of <hi>S. Angelo,</hi> &amp; could not be redeemed nor his Cardinals without a great ſumme of mony.

               <p>BEcauſe I haue ſpoken before ſomething of Theologicall Numbers, I thought it good in this Chapter to diſcourſe as touching the Art of diuine Numbering; that vnto young Students, or nouell Diuines, deſirous to bee skilled in ſuch an hie myſtery, I may preſcribe a certaine <hi>Idea</hi> or platforme for them to imitate. Which I cannot better doe, than out of the words of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> to frame them a kinde of ladder or ſcale, whereon to ſet their feete, or by whoſe direction they may ſafely walke without error. <hi>Iohn,</hi> deſirous to vnfold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs as much of the Diuinity of Chriſt and his humanity, as might be fitting for vs, beginneth thus by Numbering: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.</hi> For one of the ſecond order, is God himſelfe: and whereas within his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eſſence, production of two remaineth (for, Number conſiſteth of himſelfe, according to <hi>Beetius</hi> an excellent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7836:53"/>and according to One, the binarie Number alone naturally is procreated), it muſt needs follow, that thoſe two Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of, the beginning and the Word (the one of order, the other of Number) muſt of neceſſity bee God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe within God there can nothing be but God. Theſe three therefore, the beginning, the Word, and God, beeing the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall or fountaine of all thinge, whether they be celeſtiall, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceleſtiall, terreſtriall, corporeall, incorporeall, Angells, men, brute beaſts, plants, and ſo forth: theſe, I ſay, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend but one eſſence, ſeeing that God is one, and his vnity is indiuiſible, as the Vnarie Number is. For, this eſſence of God is nothing at all diuided, although two productions or ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are numbred out of one: as in corporeall things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it hapneth, that vnity, moued into duality (if it bee lawfull for me to make ſuch a compariſon) proceedeth to the ternary, the ſubſtance of things remaining (for, in the terne Number no compoſition can bee perceiued), as of a branch, or bough; but more fitly, the body of a man, his arme, or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Out of one therefore, produced vnto two in diuine things, ariſeth the Trinity: vnto which if eſſence bee giuen, formally diſtinguiſhed from them, it will become a formall quaternity, which is infinite; one and the Number of two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance, perfection, and end of all Number; which, by a collectiue kinde of progreſſion, make tenne in the whole, according to Arithmeticall and Geometricall computation, mainteyned often in this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Number of tenne, there is nothing; for, it fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his beginning from one, and goeth backward to one, ending where it beganne, and beginning where it on deth. So that worthily and moſt diuinely, according to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s ſacred Arithmetick, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word;</hi> and all three were one Word, onely diuine, infinite, incomprehenſible, extrinſecally aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf to man: from whoſe light infuſed, all inferior ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are directed, deriued, &amp; gouern'd; that is (according to the expoſition of the Hebrewes) <hi>ſo long as the vnderſtanding, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and intellect</hi> (expreſſing the ternary Number) <hi>be one and the ſelfe-ſame.</hi> For, as the Prophet ſaith, inſpired (no doubt) with a

               <p>I Minde not in this Chapter to play the Arithmetician, by putting Numbers for ciphers, ciphers for Numbers, as though I were an Accountant, or bredde vp in a merchants or Scriueners ſhoppe. No: I meane to frame a ſcale or lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der according to Theologicall Arithmeticke, ſuch an one as neuer was deuiſed by any man before. This is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then a ſecret manner of diſcourſing, as touching the ſubiects of euery thing, according to the harmony of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, figures, concents. Wee know, that Numbers worke much on the ſoule; figures, vpon bodies; concent, vpon creatures. I will frame our ſcale firſt; afterwards wee will proceede in order to ſpeake of all their ſubiects. Our ſcale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth ſix degrees, beginning from the higher moſt to the loweſt. The firſt is the Architypall world, in which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Third is the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall, in which are thoſe ſimple bodies, wanting all kinde of permixtion. Fourth is the leſſer world, where are placed thoſe rationall bodies. Fift is elementarie: in this are placed thoſe pure, naturall, and artificiall creatures.

               <p>In the architypall world, from whence comes the Law of prouidence, diſcourſe is made as touhing God, by ſimple Numbers, which properly ſignifie diuine things; as, denaries, celeſtiall; centenaries, terreſtriall; millenaries of the world to come, exemplified in this wiſe: Firſt, the diuine eſſence is one, the fountaine of all vertue and power. Secondly, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes in it ſelfe eternall productions, according to the will and vnderſtanding. Thirdly, exiſting in perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.

Eleuenthly, by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his heauenly grace, that is, his comfortable Spirit in his moſt holy and bleſſed name. In the intellectuall world, from whence comes the Law of deſtiny, diſcourſe is made from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences in this wiſe: Firſt, the foule of the world is one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme intelligence, the firſt creature, the fountaine of life. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is fellow vnto Angells, which hath conſtituted that there ſhould bee two intelligible ſubſtances. Thirdly, there are three hierarchies of Angells, three degrees of the bleſſed, foure triplicities or hierarchies intelligible, foure preſidents ouer the corners of heauen, foure gouernours of the elements 4 beaſts of ſanctity, 4 triplicities of Tribes, foure triplicities Apoſtles, 5 intelligible ſubſtances, ſix orders of Angels, which are not ſent to gouern beneath, 7 Angels which ſtand before the Throne of God, eight rewards of beatitudes, nine compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Angels, 9 Angells gouerning by triplicities, 10 orders of the bleſſed, bearing rule from the ſeprenary Number.</p>

               <p>In the elementarie World, where the Lawe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and corruption abideth, there is to bee found one ſubject and inſtrument of all vertues naturall and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, two elements producing a liuing ſoule, three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of elements, foure elements, as many qualities, ſeaſons, corners of the earth, perfect kindes of mixt things, ſo many kindes of creatures anſwerable to thoſe elements, fiue kindes of corruptibles, or <hi>Species Mixtorum</hi> in Plants, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, ſtones, ſix ſubſanticous qualities of elements, ſeuen birds of Planets, ſo many fiſhes of Planets, metals of Planets, beaſts and ſtones, eight particular qualities, nine ſtones, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting nine companies of Angels, tenne beaſts of ſanctity lifted vp to heauen, twelue plants, ſo many ſtones, twelue moneths, ſo many birds, twelue ſacred beaſts and trees, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by thoſe who haue treated any thing touching Orphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Theologie.</p>

The Paracelſians do ſo wonderfuly admire and praiſe the vnarie Number, that they ſtick not to define a Spagyrick after this manner: <hi>Spagyricus is eſt, quicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nouit optimè diſcernore verum à falſo, à bono malum, et impurum à puro ſegregare, et abycere binarium, vnitate ſernata.</hi> It is much in requeſt among our Geometricians, though they vſe not the name ſo much, but the thing it ſelfe. A circle therefore (beeing to them in ſtead of the vnarie) is called a line infinite; in which there is no <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> nor <hi>ad quem,</hi> (to ſpeak Logica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly), whoſe beginning and end conſiſt of euery poynt.

So that from <hi>Sol</hi> to the ſtarry element, is found a <hi>Diaſteme,</hi> a <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> of two tones and a half; from the earth, a perfect <hi>Diapazon</hi> of ſix tones integrall.

               <p>Out of which may be gathered, that what from the Fabrick of this whole Vniuerſe; what from the ſymmetry, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, harmony of all his parts linked together; what from the mutuall concent of heauens, Planets, elements, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that beautifieth the workmanſhip of the Creator more, nothing that ſo liuely ſetteth out the creature, as muſick. It is ſaid by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who borrowed it from <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>GOD, in framing of the world, had plaid the part of an excellent Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and that he cauſed this Geometricall Paradox to bee moſt truely verefied;</hi> that is, <hi>Two figures granted, a third remaineth, equall to one, like to the other.</hi> Now, it is without all queſtion, that God, by making ſo many contrary elements agree together, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo many tones and ſones to thoſe viſible and inuiſible heauens, hath plaid the part of a notable Muſician, as well as a Geometrician. But let vs go forward. The proportion of thoſe moouings of <hi>Saturn</hi> to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> is duple ſeſquialter; of <hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi> ſeſcuple; of <hi>Mars</hi> to <hi>Sol, Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> (which make their journey alike) duple proportion; of them to the Moon, duodecuple; of <hi>Saturn</hi> to the ſtelliferous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, millecuple and ducentuple.

In euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe therefore (eſpecially of this nature) Geometricall &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall, proportion is chiefly to be reſpected. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of proportion is found moſt eaſie in the ſubiects of Numbers. For, the Numbers of all ſubiects are ſo diſpoſed, that they may not exceede the Duodenarie. Seeing therefore,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7836:59"/>the Number is certaine, and as it were limited, a man ſhall ſoone finde out the proportions of diſcourſe, if he know once the higheſt <hi>Hoxagonon</hi> from the communication of correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.

As touching diſcourſe of proportion, it receiueth communication of the <hi>Hexagonon</hi> in the ſubiects of figures, as farre as thoſe figures ariſe out of Numbers, and containe within them a numerall kinde of diſcourſe. For, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery figure hath his proper fundaments from conſideration of it ſelfe; as a circle, conſidered by himſelfe, hath a plaine vertue, contented with one <hi>Superſicies,</hi> and hath lines alike brought from his center to his circumference. Likewiſe a Sphere ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his conſideration from Geometricians and Aſtronomers. Such a frame as this is beeing made, euery part admitteth his proceſſe of Art; and, as many differences haue beene aſſigned to any of theſe ſubiects, ſo many diſcrepances of tearmes as touching this workmanſhip may bee limited.
